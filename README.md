# StockAlert
Will take a look at all tables in the stock table created from stockWatcher and send email alerts when any stocks meet certain thresholds on percentage changes or set price targets to keep the user well informed of any major changes on investments as they are happening throughout the day.
Will use seperate Email Repo to keep user up to date.
